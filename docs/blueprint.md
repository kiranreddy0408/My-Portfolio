## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#333333) to create a professional, modern dark theme.
- Primary color: Vibrant cyan (#00FFFF) to highlight important elements and links.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF) to draw attention to key sections and interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for clean, modern readability. Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' for a techy feel.
- Use minimalist line icons to represent sections (experience, projects, skills). Icons should be in the accent color.
- Divide content into clear, distinct sections using a grid layout. Employ white space to improve readability and reduce clutter.
- Use subtle, smooth transitions when navigating between sections. A simple fade-in effect when loading content would be appropriate.
